A sample for resampling signal using FFT. Not that useful I suppose, as a similar effect can be achieved with spline interpolation. Nevertheless, I've published a paper, where I used such signal reconstruction (Eur J Appl Physiol. 2011 Sep;111(9):2155-62.) and I was recently asked about it, so I thought I'd share the code as well. Also, if you wanted to apply some filtering in the frequency domain and then reconstruct your signal back into time domain, the code might be useful.
